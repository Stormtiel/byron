how can she love 
such an ugly
terrible 
human like me anyway?
enough said
Sonic is a Gary Stu
You know you've seen hell
complete self-insert and Gary Stu
Just block/ignore them
I live with other beings 
That no one else can see
Very few know that they exist
They long to be free
We want to see the world 
Yet we are trapped
This crowded place we call a home
Has never seemed so empty
The default
OMG, WE SHOULD HAVE POTATO MODELS
I want to be a frozen potato
MY FRIEND JUST GOT A BAKED POTATO THROWN AT HER
random bursts of physical pain everyday
Me and my house mate just got out of coffee lab
I THINK MY HEART MIGHT EXPLODE!
WE ARE LEGION
LEGION IS US
what is air
so my friend sent me this
that was kind of rude 
for like the past year straight
she says she's in love with him 
i wish I could just cut off all ties with her
but I can't because she's my only friend
i bought a kinder egg
for the first time
in what is probably 10 years
i am so disappointed
WHERE IS TINKERBELL
bird?
science is unnecessary
half mailman, half man
yeah sure we have bath bombs
i need no pants
